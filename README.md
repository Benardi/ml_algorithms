# Touvlo

This project provides Machine Learning algorithms and models implemented from scratch. These implementation aren't meant to be performatic, but instead to expose the logic of the components/blocks that make the Machine Learning models possible. For this reason the routines employed by the models are also provided and tested separately.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

To make use of this project you need both python3 and pip3.
Both are readily available in packages: 

```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3
sudo apt install python3-pip
```
To run the testing environments we have provided you'll also need to install tox

```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install tox
```

**Optionally**: venv

### Installing

Clone and enter the directory using cd

```
git clone https://github.com/Benardi/touvlo

cd touvlo 
```

Use venv to keep dependencies tidy, but you may opt not to use it.
Create a new directory inside the project directory where will keep the dependencies as 'venv'.

```
python3 -m venv ./venv
```

Source the venv to activate it.

```
source venv/bin/activate
```

Use pip to install the requirements

```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

# Running the tests

To execute all testing environments simply run 

```
tox
``` 

## Unit tests

To execute only the unit tests, run 

```
tox -e py35
``` 

## Coding style tests

To execute only the coding style tests, run 

```
tox -e pep8
```
